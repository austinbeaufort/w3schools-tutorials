    <!-- HTML DOM METHODS ARE ACTIONS YOU CAN PERFORM.
    HTML DOM PROPERTIES ARE VALUES THAT YOU CAN SET OR CHANGE.

    IN THE DOM, ALL HTML ELEMENTS ARE DEFINED AS OBJECTS.
    A PROPERTY IS A VALUE THAT YOU CAN GET OR SET.
    A METHOD IS AN ACTION YOU CAN DO. -->

    <!-- <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = "Hello, world!";
    </script> -->
<!-- 
    IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, GETELEMENTBYID IS A METHOD WHILD 'innerHTML' is a property.

    THE MOST COMMON WAY TO ACCESS AN HTML ELEMENT IS TO USE THE 'ID' OF THE ELEMENT.

    THE EASIEST WAY TO GET THE CONTENT OF AN ELEMENT IS BY USING THE 'innerHTML' PROPERTY. -->
